Explanation of Key Sections
	1.	Telegram Web App Script
	•	<script src="https://telegram.org/js/telegram-web-app.js"></script> is essential for making Telegram’s WebApp APIs available in your page.
	2.	MainButton Logic
	•	The code shows how to set up a "Save Game" button within Telegram’s interface.
	•	You can customize the text, color, visibility, and click behavior.
	3.	Local Storage
	•	Demonstrates saving gameState to localStorage. This is useful for lightweight persistence.
	•	For sensitive data or more complex operations, consider a server-side approach.
	4.	Responsive Design Basics
	•	Includes a basic meta viewport tag and minimal inline styling.
	•	For production, move styles into an external styles.css.
	5.	Event Listeners
	•	Listens for DOMContentLoaded to ensure the DOM is loaded before running Telegram’s initialization.

Tips & Customizations
	•	Theme & Branding: Replace the placeholder text, colors, and fonts with your game’s branding.
	•	Modular JavaScript: As your project grows, refactor JS into separate modules or files.
	•	Error Handling: Implement try-catch blocks or checks to ensure localStorage is available.
	•	Security: For storing sensitive or large amounts of data, use a secure server-side solution.

This basic structure should get you started with your Arcane Empires Mini App. As you develop your game, you’ll likely add additional UI elements (status bars, forging menus, chat logs) and tie them into both Telegram and in-game logic for a richer player experience.
